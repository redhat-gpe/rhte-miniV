Experience using Kepler to measure container energy consumption.
</p>

<p>Kepler is a software tool that enables users to measure the energy consumption of containers. It is built on top of Kubernetes and uses eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) technology to probe energy-related system statistics. eBPF is a tracing and profiling technology that has been integrated into the Linux kernel, enabling Kepler to access low-level kernel information and collect data on the energy consumption of containerized applications. Kepler exports this data as Prometheus metrics, allowing organizations to analyze energy consumption trends over time.</p>

<p>Kepler is designed to be lightweight and user-friendly, with a simple interface that streamlines the process of collecting energy consumption data. Its integration with Kubernetes also makes it highly scalable, making it suitable for large-scale container deployments. By providing insights into container energy usage, Kepler can help organizations optimize their energy consumption and reduce their carbon footprint.</p>
